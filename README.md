# Cellular-Automata-Visualizer
Unity open-source project that simulates cellular life. All started with Conway's Game of Life, but furthermore i extended with transport networks simulation inspired from
**Characteristics of Pattern Formation and Evolution in Approximations of __Physarum__ Transport Networks** by Jeff Jones. It uses a compute shader for filtering with
a mean 3x3 kernel in order to have a relative high scale environment framework, so basically the app requires a high performance device in order to render the results.
